do a copyright and lame info like that component

need to figure out path intersection

do dynamic import of toolbar mobile or full size based on environment?

okay, so you can do diagonal reflects, will research more how to do that

before we see about native:

shapes
x and y reflects
color selections
clear to three colors

later:

more reflects
path intersection on shapes
different toolbars for environments
dynamic import of toolbars
erase
strokes
grads
eyedropper
key bindings
stamps
no doubt lots of other stuff too
set async/local storage to store drawing on unmount

see about loss on drag speed issue to stack overflow?
