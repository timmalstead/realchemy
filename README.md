do a copyright and lame info like that component

okay, so you can do diagonal reflects, will research more how to do that

before we see about native:

5 rows of 2em by 2em tool icons might work

path intersection

build out options object and icon

later:

copyright component

opacitys
miter limit,
line cap butt round square
more reflects
different toolbars for environments
dynamic import of toolbars
key bindings
stamps
no doubt lots of other stuff too
set async/local storage to store drawing on unmount
and to store drawing component options in addition to current stroke/tool options

see about loss on drag speed issue to stack overflow?
