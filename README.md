send toolbarActions to drawing tools reducer? how can we improve that?

build out options objects and icons
path intersection
copyright component
zoom!
okay, so you can do diagonal reflects, will research more how to do that
opacitys
miter limit,
line cap butt round square
dynamic import of toolbars
stamps
no doubt lots of other stuff too
set async/local storage to store drawing on unmount
and to store drawing component options in addition to current stroke/tool options
make into pwa
better code splitting

see about loss on drag speed issue to stack overflow?
